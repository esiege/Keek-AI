# tasks/

**Task definitions and state files**

This directory contains:
- Task JSON/Markdown files with unique IDs
- Task state tracking (planned → dev → qa → ops → done)
- Owner assignments for each task
- Acceptance criteria and definitions

Tasks are explicit handoff objects between roles. Each task has a single owner at a time.
